### Hi there 👋

- 🏄🏻 I am an enthusiastic data analyst with a postgraduate degree in Business Analytics, a degree in Accounting and a background in auditing and accounting.
- 📈 My career was driven early on by my ambition to always support my conclusions with data and leverage available data as a strategic resource.
- ✔️ Like many other business professionals, I took Excel as far as I could, until I made the decision to venture into the world of data analytics.
- 💪 Now, with a solid foundation in Python, SQL, Tableau and PowerBi I am well prepared to meet the challenges of data-driven decision making. 
- 💡 Leveraging my analytical mindset developed over years of auditing, I'm excited to contribute positively to projects that positively impact people's lives.
- 📫 I would like you to check out my projects and do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can make a positive contribution to your project.

### thank you for visiting 👋
