### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I am an enthusiastic data analyst with a postgraduate degree in Business Analytics, a degree in Accounting and experience in auditing and accounting.
- ðŸ”­ My career was driven early on by my ambition to always support my conclusions with data and leverage available data as a strategic resource. Like many other business professionals, I took Excel as far as I could, until I made the decision to venture into the world of data analytics.
- ðŸ’¬ Now, with a solid foundation in Python, SQL, Tableau and PowerBi I am well prepared to meet the challenges of data-driven decision making. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Leveraging my analytical mindset developed over years of auditing, I'm excited to contribute positively to projects that positively impact people's lives.
- ðŸ“« I would like you to check out my projects and do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can make a positive contribution to your project.

### thank you for visiting ðŸ‘‹
